#### SafeWalk – A Personal Safety App for Women

 - In today's world, ensuring women’s safety in public and private
   spaces remains a critical challenge. Many women experience
   discomfort, harassment, or unsafe situations while commuting alone at
   night, using ride-sharing services, or walking through unfamiliar
   areas. There is a pressing need for a mobile solution that allows
   them to stay connected with their trusted contacts, access emergency
   assistance, and make informed decisions about their safety in
   real-time. 
  - As part of an initiative by a non-profit organization
   advocating for gender equality (aligned with SDG Goal 5: Gender
   Equality), you have been hired as an Android developer to create a
   functional prototype of an app called "SafeWalk." Imagine you are a
   freelance Android developer approached by a non-profit organization
   working towards gender equality. They are launching an initiative to
   improve women’s safety and accessibility in public spaces through a
   mobile app. 
  - This app aims to provide real-time location sharing,
   emergency alerts, and quick access to safety features, empowering
   women to feel more secure in their daily lives. Given the urgency of
   the project, you have only 3 hours to build a working prototype that
   demonstrates the core functionalities. Your solution will be
   evaluated based on its usability, technical implementation, and
   potential impact.
